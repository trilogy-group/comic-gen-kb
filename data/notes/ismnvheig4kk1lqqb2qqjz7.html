<h2 id="conclusion-1"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion-1"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Almost all cases, GPT does manage to relate seemingly opposite topics to the incident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also another observation is that the deviation from original story is minimal in case of allergies hence would be preferred by the customer the most</p>
