Anime characters do age, while superman, a character that has been there since about 80 years, has had so many reboots that the character stays the same\n- Mangas having a continuity at the very core, would be hard to simulate that feel through discontinuous comic strips\n\n## What makes an excellent manga?\n- This is subjective and the answer for this comes from a bunch of sources including mine\n- A shonen feels good to me when there is great character development accompanied with a powerup. This fulfils me after reading the manga.\n- Excellent artwork can distract the user away from a weak storyline for a short panel, but in the long run story line is what matters.\n- A great supporting cast of fun, interesting, unique characters who keep the story moving along and teach the main character lessons they need to learn.\n\n### Insights\n- I feel that if we stick to just discontinous comic panels, we can get away with the usual continuity of characters in the manga as long as we have great artwork. It would give the user the feel that they are indeed reading a manga and have them learn the concept\n- If we wanna make a good manga that will hook the users to our app, then we should think about making continous mangas throughout the curriculum where one is the continuation to the other.\n\n## Manga making process\n- Scripting\n    - Figure out the genre & theme\n    - workout the characters and their personality + sketch their appearance (it should fit their personality)\n    - Draft your script: from the introduction to the ending, along with the development and the various twists and turns\n    - Split your script into sections. You need to divide your script into several sequences. Each sequence needs to be a single unity: of place, of time or of action (he action takes place in a cafeteria / the hero is getting up / the hero confronts his rival ). Next, a pre-script involves associating a certain number of panels (pages) with each sequence to describe it.\n\n- Storyboard\n    - A storyboard is a visual representation of a story, broken down into individual panels. It's used to pre-visualize the sequence of events, typically in film, animation, or comic creation. It includes details like scene direction, dialogue, and action.\n\n- Pencil sketching \n\n- Inking in\n\n### Insights\n- This can give an idea of how the script prompt might be\n\n## Conclusion\n- Mangas are significantly different than traditional comics \n- If we go ahead with the discontinuous panels approach, we can distract the user from lack of continuity with great artwork but a great hook in the long run would be, since the curriculum is sequential by nature, we could generate comics that are continuous in their storyline\n","n":0.032}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Other Documents","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Welcome to the Other Documents page\n\nHere you can find all the documents that don't fit the description of \"research\" or \"experiments\"\n\n","n":0.213}}},{"i":5,"$":{"0":{"v":"Dendron","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Making a Dendron Knoweledge Base\n\n## DoD\n- [x] Research on Dendron\n- [x] Make a knoweledge base for comic gen \n- [x] Write a brief tutorial\n\n### Why to use dendron?\n- Dendron pages are all markdown so you can have fell formatted documents especially when they include code unlike Google Docs\n- Dendron pages are hosted by us, so there's no scare of data being lost like notion\n- Dendron links can be accessibly by anyone without the need of permission unlike docs written in github issues\n- All documents pertaining to the project would be accessible from one site which is a great thing to have\n\n## Tutorial\n\n1.
