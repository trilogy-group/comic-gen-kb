class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#manga-genre\"></a>Manga Genre</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike your usual american superhero comics, mangas are first segmented on sex and age and then they're segmented on themes</li>\n<li>Example:\n<ul>\n<li>Shonen\n<ul>\n<li>Targeted at teen boys</li>\n<li>They focus on topics like coming of age, camradrie and often have loads of action and comedy</li>\n<li>Some of the best examples are Naruto, Jujutsu Kaisen, One Piece etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Seinen\n<ul>\n<li>Targeted at adult men</li>\n<li>They focus on darker themes like graphic violence, foul language, sexual situations</li>\n<li>Usually if a manga doesn't fit into Shonen or Shojo it is put under Seinen.</li>\n<li>Beserk is one of the most critically acclaimed manga and is a perfect example of seinen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Shojo\n<ul>\n<li>Targeted at teen girls</li>\n<li>The focus is less on action and more on drama, emotion and almost always idealized romance</li>\n<li>Like shonen manga, shojo manga usually feature the coming-of-age story of a young protagonist.</li>\n<li>Sailor moon is a famous Shojo</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Josei\n<ul>\n<li>Targeted at adult women</li>\n<li>Features mature narratives exploring romatic &#x26; personal relationships and often have more depth than Shojo</li>\n<li>Loveless is one of the most famous Josei</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Kodomomuke\n<ul>\n<li>Targeted at children</li>\n<li>Fun moralisitc mangas</li>\n<li>Pokemon is the most famous one</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"insights\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#insights\"></a>Insights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Our audience is mostly school kids, Hence manga in the genre shonen ,shojo or kodomuke would be fit</li>\n<li>Although genre choice based on the gender of the student might be problematic since our customers are american schools where talks of gender have become topics of controversy</li>\n<li>Hence we can use this to randomly generate one of the two for older students and kodomuke for younger audiences</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"visual-differences\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#visual-differences\"></a>Visual differences</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>They are read from right to left and top to bottom which is unlike their american counterparts that are read left to right and top to bottom</li>\n<li>They are exclusively in black and white and are just pure sketches</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"insights-1\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#insights-1\"></a>Insights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Artwork is something crucial to mangas and is something that we would need to be perfected in order to simulate the feel of it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-way-the-story-is-created--told\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-way-the-story-is-created--told\"></a>The way the story is created &#x26; told</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In american comics, they are often told by several comic houses over the years leading to inconsistensies and differences in the character over the years and there is an effort for characters to fit into the current context.</li>\n<li>In order to justify this, the two big american comic houses DC &#x26; Marvel invented the concept of \"Multiverses\"</li>\n<li>Mangas however are more often than not the product of a single author's vision/work from the first to the final volume and hence have more consistent characters throughout the comic</li>\n<li>In mangas, character transformation throughout the volumes are in power level or in the maturity of the characters we follow growing up</li>\n<li>his is why shonen manga feature important life lessons that often target young people, teaching them values such as respect , courage, friendship.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"insights-2\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#insights-2\"></a>Insights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This is something I never thought about critically, but was actually something true. Anime characters do age, while superman, a character that has been there since about 80 years, has had so many reboots that the character stays the same</li>\n<li>Mangas having a continuity at the very core, would be hard to simulate that feel through discontinuous comic strips</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-an-excellent-manga\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-makes-an-excellent-manga\"></a>What makes an excellent manga?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This is subjective and the answer for this comes from a bunch of sources including mine</li>\n<li>A shonen feels good to me when there is great character development accompanied with a powerup. This fulfils me after reading the manga.</li>\n<li>Excellent artwork can distract the user away from a weak storyline for a short panel, but in the long run story line is what matters.</li>\n<li>A great supporting cast of fun, interesting, unique characters who keep the story moving along and teach the main character lessons they need to learn.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"insights-3\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#insights-3\"></a>Insights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I feel that if we stick to just discontinous comic panels, we can get away with the usual continuity of characters in the manga as long as we have great artwork. It would give the user the feel that they are indeed reading a manga and have them learn the concept</li>\n<li>If we wanna make a good manga that will hook the users to our app, then we should think about making continous mangas throughout the curriculum where one is the continuation to the other.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"manga-making-process\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#manga-making-process\"></a>Manga making process</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Scripting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Figure out the genre &#x26; theme</li>\n<li>workout the characters and their personality + sketch their appearance (it should fit their personality)</li>\n<li>Draft your script: from the introduction to the ending, along with the development and the various twists and turns</li>\n<li>Split your script into sections. You need to divide your script into several sequences. Each sequence needs to be a single unity: of place, of time or of action (he action takes place in a cafeteria / the hero is getting up / the hero confronts his rival ). Next, a pre-script involves associating a certain number of panels (pages) with each sequence to describe it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Storyboard</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A storyboard is a visual representation of a story, broken down into individual panels. It's used to pre-visualize the sequence of events, typically in film, animation, or comic creation. It includes details like scene direction, dialogue, and action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pencil sketching </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inking in</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"insights-4\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#insights-4\"></a>Insights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This can give an idea of how the script prompt might be</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mangas are significantly different than traditional comics </li>\n<li>If we go ahead with the discontinuous panels approach, we can distract the user from lack of continuity with great artwork but a great hook in the long run would be, since the curriculum is sequential by nature, we could generate comics that are continuous in their storyline</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1689336026010,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"218a6d5764c2b5aefaded9886d7b317e","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-comic-gen-kb":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to Comic Gen KB","value":"welcome-to-comic-gen-kb","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["851xp22233jr4l9woml19un","spyuk5upewy9qpqlcj03z36","fnhs577xc0bxbeg6v4lku5o"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Welcome to Comic Gen KB\n\nThis is a knoweledge base of all Research, Experiments and other documents relating to the Comic Gen project!\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"dendronVersion":"0.95.0","enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enableSmartRefs":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"assetsPrefix":"/comic-gen-kb","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"enableSiteLastModified":true,"siteRootDir":"docs","siteUrl":"https://trilogy-group.github.io","enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"writeStubs":false,"seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal knowledge space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enablePrettyLinks":true,"theme":"dark","enableTaskNotes":true,"templateVersion":"0.97.0","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root","searchMode":"lookup"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
